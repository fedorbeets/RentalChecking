# Rental Checking

Using a conjunctive equality test to determine if 2 vectors are equal we can translate rental requirements into one vector (token) and actual properties of those requirements into a different vector (rule), encrypt the vectors at different stages and then check for equality. This lets one check if a renter meets all requirements set out by a landlord without the landlord learning any information about the renter other than that they fullfill the requirements.
